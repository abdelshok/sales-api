            1. You can change individual prices or volume prices of existing products (ie. A, B, etc).  
            2. You can also create new products by typing a new product name in the input that is going to follow.
            3. The new product that you create needs to be a single alphabetic character. Yes this means, that there is a maximum of 26 products.
            4. After you choose a new product, whether it is a newly invented one or an already existing one, the commmand line is going to ask you
            to choose the price first, and then the quantity. 
            5. The first price of a newly created product needs to always be set for an individual item (quantity=1). A product cannot be created by
            directly setting a volume quantity. 
            Ie. If you want to create a product 'Z', the CLI will first ask you the name of the product. Input 'Z'. It will then ask for the price of
            'Z'. Let's assume that it's set to 100. After that the CLI will ask for the quantity. The first quantity entry needs to be 1, meanining that
            one unit of 'Z' will cost $100. Any unit other than 1 will return an error. \n
            â€¢ If you want to reset the product list, exit the program and re-start it.

            Act accordingly.
