## Design Points

This project does not have a front-end, only a back-end. It is the product of **one** npm project. There is therefore only one `package.json` and therefore only one place to run npm commands --> in the root directory.

  1. **Node server**: [`./package.json`](package.json)
      * Add more comments here

## Demo

In order to run the application, simply:

  1. `git clone` the **sales-api** file into one of your directories
  2. Go into the aforementioned file on your terminal
  3. Make sure to run `npm install` to install all of the dependencies 
  4. Finally, run `node index.js` (make sure that you are the root of the directory)

Now, you can simply play around with the project ‚ö°Ô∏è
